## Application Legitimacy

Office Tool Plus is based on Microsoft's [Office Deployment Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/overview-of-the-office-customization-tool-for-click-to-run). And we added some functions according to the needs of users.

### About Activate Function

The activate function was based on Microsoft's ospp.vbs (Office Software Protect Platform), all activate operations are performed by ospp.vbs. And in order to let users better understand OSPP, we translated it (zh-cn, zh-tw).

You can view the description of OSPP in ````"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.HTM"```` (Office installed required).

## Help With Localization

We encourage everyone to help with localization. The following is how to do.

1. Fork this repository

2. Translate ````zh-cn.xaml```` to your own language then save it like ````zh-tw.xaml````

3. Copy it to the right path, like OfficeToolPlus/Language/zh-tw.xaml

4. Make a Pull Request.

### How To Test Your Translation

1. Save your translation file to a path, like ````D:\Date\zh-cn.xaml````.

2. Open application.

3. Go to settings page, click ````Load localization file.````

4. Select the file that you just saved.

After that, application will load your translation, if you are adding a new translation to application, it will show: failed to connect to server. It's normal.

### What is More

For each translator, we will give them an Admin app that allows you to change the announcement and upload a background image.

````Admin app is still developing.````

## Help With Coding

If you have any ideas about coding, you can fork this repository and coding by yourself, after done, make a pull request and explain what you changed and how to use it or why you change it.

Thanks you very much.

But actually, it is only contains partial codes, (●ˇ∀ˇ●) so you can only use editor such as NotePad.

Note: You CAN'T copy this codes to use without my permisson!
