# Office Tool Plus Localization

XAML files are localized files used by Office Tool Plus. We recommend that you use VScode or another editor for translation.

## Precautions

Don't change any string or word like this:

```xml
<!-- Channels Name -->
{0}
{1}
&#x000A;
```

## How to Test

When you finished translation, open Office Tool Plus, press Ctrl + P to open command, and input `/setLangRes [YourFileFullPath]`, finally press Enter.

## How to Submit

You can use GitHub to submit your translation, or you can send me your file via [E-mail](mailto:yerong@coolhub.top)

Thank you!
